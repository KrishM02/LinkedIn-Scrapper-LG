The new facility will serve both India's growing domestic demand and key export markets—including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and the Middle East. Its strategic location near Chennai offers logistics advantages for Southern India and international markets. Sri City marks a significant step in LG’s commitment to localization, regional growth, and speed-to-market.

It’s about solving. As a marketing intern at LG Electronics , I’ve realized something powerful: The most underrated skill in corporate life is the ability to observe quietly — and act loudly through results. Every day here, I’m not just checking tasks off a list — I’m spotting gaps, pitching in, and learning how large teams move like one. Whether it's: Taking ownership of product demos during weekend activations Coordinating on-ground branding touchpoints Or simply being the “go-to” for the small things that keep execution smooth... I’m learning that leadership doesn’t wait for a title. It starts with initiative. My biggest takeaway so far? Small contributions make a big difference — especially when no one’s watching. Huge thanks to LG India , Shiksha Rawat ma'am, and my amazing team for trusting me with responsibilities that go beyond intern labels. Grateful to be a part of a culture that values contribution over hierarchy.

Here’s why this IPO is making serious waves in the Indian markets: ₹15,000 Crore 100% Offer for Sale (OFS) – The Korean parent is unlocking value by listing LG India, and investors are taking note. Market Leadership – From washing machines and microwaves to premium ACs, LG India is dominating categories with strong brand equity. Untapped Potential – Did you know only 20% of Indian households own a washing machine? Compare that to near saturation in markets like China—and you’ll see why LG is so bullish on India’s growth story. Make in India in Action – With local manufacturing hubs in Noida & Pune and a new plant coming up in Andhra Pradesh, LG is embracing the PLI scheme and scaling sustainably. Future-Ready Distribution – From modern trade & brand stores to e-commerce and deep rural penetration—LG’s hybrid approach is a blueprint for how to win in India. Interning here while all of this is unfolding has been surreal—learning how strategy, execution, and innovation come together in real-time has been invaluable. Whether you’re tracking IPOs, consumer trends, or India’s economic rise, this story is one to watch closely. Let’s talk: What’s your take on LG India’s bold move?

Unfortunately, the refrigerator started making noise and stopped proper cooling some 15 days ago. I had the foresight to purchase an AMC, so I raised a complaint immediately with LG. What followed has been a frustrating and unacceptable experience: 1. Multiple technician visits with no clear diagnosis. 2. Eventually identified a faulty part — only for the wrong part to be shipped. 3. Now I’m told the correct part is “in transit” for over 10 days, with no transparency or updates. This kind of delay and lack of communication, especially in a major metro like NCR, is shocking. Is NCR not even equipped with a functional LG warehouse or service infrastructure? What worries me more is that most of my home appliances — AC, microwave, etc. — are from LG. I’m seriously questioning if I made the right decision trusting this brand. This is not the customer experience one expects after investing in a premium product and extended warranty.

So I was in Jodhpur recently on a personal trip. Hired an auto to travel 50 km north. Somewhere en route, the auto guy says, “Bhaiya, ek minute. CNG bharwani hai.” Fair enough. But instead of heading to a proper pump, he turns into what looked like a garage-slash-workshop-slash-jugaad-factory. And out comes… a domestic LPG cylinder. Yes, you read that right. The guy literally filled his auto using a kitchen gas cylinder. I looked at him — confused, amused, mildly concerned for my safety. He grins and goes: “Yeh sasta padta hai. CNG pump se aadha bhi nahi bharta, isse full ho jaata hai.” ⸻ Now let’s take a moment to appreciate the brilliance and madness of it all: What I witnessed: Innovation Risk-taking Questionable legality Zero concern for safety Perfect raw material for a B-school case study ⸻ Management Takeaways: 1. KPIs gone rogue – He’s measuring tank fullness, not fuel quality, engine life, or, y’know, not blowing up. 2. Jugaad > Systems – When formal solutions get too expensive, people build informal ones. That’s not mischief, that’s unmet demand. 3. Short-term gain, long-term… fire? – Cost-cutting is great, until the cost is your engine… or eyebrows. 4. There’s always a better way. But sometimes that way is hiding behind a domestic LPG cylinder and a very confident auto guy. ⸻ TL;DR: When people say India runs on jugaad — they mean it literally. And sometimes, it runs on your kitchen gas. ⸻ P.S. This post was whipped up with help from ChatGPT — because if the auto guy can use AI (Auto Innovation), so can I. # JugaadDiaries # OnlyInIndia # RealLifeMBA # FuelForThought # LPGNotCNG # LeadershipLessons # StreetSmarts # InnovationEverywhere # ChatGPTHelped # JodhpurChronicles","28","positive","0.134","2025-07-17 06:04:24"

Here are a few key takeaways that have already reshaped my understanding of marketing and professional growth: 1. Strategy is built on insight, not just ideas Great campaigns don’t begin with design — they start with a deep understanding of the customer and a clear, focused objective. 2. Market research is a competitive advantage Data-backed insights, consumer trends, and competitor analysis are powerful tools — they guide creative direction and sharpen execution. 3. Meetings are mini masterclasses Observing how teams discuss, challenge, and refine ideas has been one of the most underrated and valuable parts of this journey so far. 4. Communication shapes execution Whether through emails, pitches, or day-to-day updates — precise, structured communication improves clarity, collaboration, and outcomes. 5. Design drives decision-making I’ve learned that impactful design doesn’t just look good — it communicates faster, builds trust, and directly supports marketing goals. 6. Curiosity opens doors to growth Some of the best lessons came when I stepped beyond my task list — asking “why,” volunteering for new tasks, or simply listening in. Grateful to be part of an environment that encourages learning, challenges thinking, and values fresh perspectives. Looking forward to everything still ahead — because each day continues to bring something new.

I am blind and cannot see through eyes. But I use screen reading software which describes elements of the screen using speech. I live independently with my wife who is also blind. In the winter of 2024, I could not heat the gajar ka halwa which my mom sent. On March 14 2025 (celebrated as Holi), food supply from restaurants was slightly hit and we ended up eating food which was quite distasteful. I was looking for a solution which enables me to cook independently and overcome my dependence on human support. None of the electronic appliances in the market have accessibility baked in. When I was looking for a microwave oven, all of them had two problem-glass touch panels and no way for a consumer with blindness to know what's there on the screen. Which simply means that consumers with blindness are simply shut out from using these products. Even the specs on the website were inaccessible. While not a perfect solution, LG's Microwave Oven built in with wi-fi connectivity enabled me to not only heat but even cook independently. Its just been a few days cooking, but at least a major dependence on others is taken care by just having an electronic appliance which you are able to operate independently. I was able to cook Poha / Puffed Rice, Lentils, Khichdi, Bottle Gourd, to name a few.

In just a few days, I've moved from textbooks to territory maps, from classroom concepts to counter realities. Here's what made this week truly enriching: Retail Outlet Visits – Witnessed the power of in-store branding, customer touchpoints, and the strategic placement of products that influence buying decisions. Promoter Training Session – Had the chance to interact with LG’s frontline force—the passionate promoters who bring the brand to life for customers. Their insights, energy, and deep product knowledge truly impressed me. Real-time Distribution Exposure – Gained a deeper understanding of how regions, branches, and local markets are structured and managed. The system is huge—and every part matters. What made these experiences more meaningful was how familiar it all felt. Why? Because I had already seen these models come alive in classroom discussions.

Big news in the Indian stock market—LG Electronics India just got SEBI’s green light for its massive ₹15,000 crore IPO. This isn’t just any listing; it could be India’s fifth-largest IPO ever and the second South Korean company to list here after Hyundai. LG’s Journey – From Lucky Goldstar to Market Leader LG wasn’t always the tech giant we know today. It started as Lucky Goldstar, rebranded to LG in 1995, and went on to dominate home appliances and consumer electronics worldwide. Fast forward, it became a household name in India with refrigerators, washing machines, ACs, and TVs leading the market. How Big is LG in India? Numbers don’t lie—LG India made ₹64,087 crore in revenue in FY24. Their home appliances business alone raked in over ₹14,000 crore last year. Here's the sales breakdown: Refrigerators: 29% Washing Machines: 21% ACs: 20% TVs: 19% They’re the No. 1 brand in refrigerators, washing machines, and microwaves. In ACs and TVs, they’re neck and neck with top competitors. Why This IPO Matters This IPO isn’t about raising money for expansion—it’s an offer-for-sale (OFS), meaning LG’s South Korean parent is selling a 15% stake. The goal? Increase brand visibility, improve market perception, and create liquidity. Post-IPO, LG Korea will still own a majority stake. The Bigger Picture – Why Now? LG’s Future Vision 2030 is about moving beyond appliances to smart living solutions—think AI, IoT, and B2B expansion. They want 45% of their revenue from B2B by 2030 (up from 27% in 2021). Their ThinQ ON AI hub is an example of this shift—an AI-powered smart home system learning from users’ habits. The Challenges Ahead Even giants face hurdles: Tough Competition: India’s electronics market is crowded with global and local players. Tech Disruption: Innovation moves fast—brands that don’t keep up, fall behind. Supply Chain Costs: Rising shipping expenses and inventory adjustments have impacted profits. Final Thoughts LG’s IPO comes at a time when India’s stock market is struggling with weak quarters and global policy shift and investors are looking for solid, well-established brands. Their dominance in appliances gives them a strong footing, but how they adapt to AI, IoT, and commercial markets will define their future. for more such insights follow CA Chakshu Asija # IPO # StockMarket # LGIndia # Investing # ConsumerElectronics # fundamentalanalysis","87","neutral","0.063","2025-07-17 06:05:56"

My 65” LG LED TV developed rust, which led to the identification of a manufacturing defect—a missing protective coating. This issue not only highlights a serious lapse in quality control but also raises concerns about the substandard materials used in what is supposed to be a premium product. Despite clear evidence (see attached photos/documents) showing this issue, LG India refused to honor the warranty, instead blaming “liquid damage.” What’s even more concerning is that, despite repeated requests, LG India has not provided the official report or charge sheet explaining the cause. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to seek legal recourse or resolve the issue fairly. I’m sharing this to encourage everyone to be vigilant about their consumer rights and to demand accountability from manufacturers.

From setting up displays to engaging directly with consumers, these activations have given me a front-row seat to how marketing lives and breathes beyond strategy decks. Here's what these weekends have taught me: Every interaction is a brand impression. Whether it’s answering a question, demonstrating a feature, or just smiling — I’ve realized how much impact even the smallest moment can have on how people perceive a brand. Marketing starts where the consumer stands. Consumer feedback is raw, honest, and instant. I’ve seen what excites, what confuses, and what converts — insights no dashboard can replicate. Execution is everything. From aligning with retail teams to managing tight timelines, I’ve understood how critical planning, adaptability, and team coordination are in delivering a seamless experience. These real-time learnings have made me respect not just the strategy behind a brand, but the sweat that powers it forward. Would love to hear from fellow marketers: What’s one thing you’ve only learned by being in the field? # LifeAtLG # ProductActivation # MarketingInternship # BrandExperience # ConsumerEngagement # RealWorldMarketing # OnGroundLearning # CorporateLearning # FutureMarketer # LGIndia # InternshipJourney # ProfessionalGrowth # LinkedInCommunity # WeekendWithPurpose","63","neutral","0.076","2025-07-17 06:06:39"

Countless Lessons. Two months ago, I walked into LG Electronics as a Marketing Intern — with excitement, curiosity, and a hunger to learn. What I didn’t expect? That in just 60 days, this internship would reshape how I view marketing, strategy, and brand responsibility. From boardrooms to upcountry markets From pitch decks to promoter training rooms From analysing consumer insights to generating actual revenue I’ve worn many hats, and every experience has left its mark. Here’s how the last 2 months shaped me: Strategic Thinking → I’ve learned how data turns into insights… and insights turn into decisions that move the market. ‍ On-Ground Execution → I visited retail stores, studied visibility gaps, and made recommendations that directly impact consumer experience. Trade Partner Understanding → I listened — really listened — to what’s working, what’s not, and how marketing can empower the channel. Sales Learning → I sold my first OLED TV worth ₹2 Lakhs — and realized that marketing is nothing if it doesn’t drive trust and action. Biggest Shift Marketing isn’t just about campaigns or content. It’s about owning the brand at every touchpoint — from insights to in-store. Grateful to LG India and the mentors who believed in me, especially Shiksha Rawat ma’am — for guiding me, trusting me, and challenging me to grow beyond my JD. Here’s to the final stretch — learning more, building more, and pushing the boundaries of what I thought I could do.

I recently sat down with Vinamre Kasanaa on Dostcast for a conversation that was far more personal than I expected. We spoke about what it really means to carry a family legacy - not just the glory, but the weight. The kind that doesn’t come with inheritance, but with inherited debt. At 30, I found myself navigating one of India’s largest business transitions, rebuilding not just a company, but a vision. Today, INOXGFL stands at: - ₹90,000 crore market cap - ₹18,000 crore in orders - ₹6,000 crore invested in EVs - And operations in 16 countries But behind the numbers is a quieter journey - of responsibility, resilience, and relentless clarity about where India’s clean energy future is headed.

We already have NavIC, our regional navigation system, but it's mainly for military and limited commercial use. Imagine if we build a full-fledged Indian-owned civilian GPS system — not reliant on foreign systems like the USA's GPS or Europe's Galileo. Imagine how many jobs this could create — in satellite manufacturing, software, hardware, location-based services, app development, logistics tech, and more. Imagine the cost savings for Indian startups like Zomato, Swiggy, Rapido, Ola, etc., who currently pay foreign companies (directly or indirectly) for location services. WHY NOW? If tomorrow, a foreign country restricts access to their GPS (like USA blocking GPS for India in a geopolitical crisis), we would struggle. A self-reliant India in navigation tech = stronger economy + stronger security. With government + private sector collaboration, we can create an affordable, high-precision, pan-India satellite navigation system for civilians and businesses.

If successful, this would rank as India's fifth-largest IPO. The offering, structured as an Offer for Sale, will divest 101.8 million equity shares—equivalent to a 15% stake in the company. Here’s why this IPO is making waves Market Leader: LG has dominated the Indian home appliances market for 13 consecutive years, holding the top spot in offline value market share (excluding mobile phones). Robust Growth: The company reported a revenue of ₹21,352 crore for FY24, solidifying its position as a key player. Expansion Plans: A new ₹5,000 crore manufacturing facility is set to come up in Sri City, Andhra Pradesh, boosting its “Make in India” commitment. But the journey isn’t without challenges. Why LG India has flagged potential risks like increasing competition and the absence of exclusivity agreements with its South Korean parent. With the absence of exclusive agreement with its parent co, Hi-M Solutek India that they will not expand business in the future to compete with LG india LG India leads in the indianmarket in: > Refrigerators > Washing Machines > Microwaves & Ovens Hi-M Solutek India specialises in LG commercial AC services and maintenance. These services comprises provision of system air conditioner construction materials, equipment integrated service &maintenance as well as special faility engineering services. Business streams are different, isn't it? Then why, LG India is worried >LG Electronics is focusing on expanding its B2B market, particularly in the home appliance and air conditioning sectors, to secure a stable profit base amid challenges in the B2C segment due to the economic downturn. >Unlike the price-sensitive consumer market, the B2B sector offers opportunities for larger-scale unit sales and long-term customer relationships, making it a strategic priority for growth. >This shift marks a significant move to diversify revenue streams. >During the AHR Expo 2023, CEO Cho highlighted the potential for growth in both developed and emerging markets, emphasizing LG’s ambition to become the global leader in system air conditioning. This was the statement made by the CEO in AHR Expo 2023. Thus, this is one of the major reasons LG India is facing as there is no assurance that its parent co will not plan towards the expansion. >In addition to IPO, LG India this month test-launched subscription service at Select LG exclusive stores catering to premium consumers >The company has increased its localization of components from 45% in 2022 to 58.3% in 2024 While LG India leads the home appliance market, potential competition from its South Korean parent company, the company is proactively addressing these challenges as part of its growth narrative.

But there's one truth we can’t ignore and that is no state can grow without industry and no industry can thrive without policy certainty. Across the country, transformational industrial projects are often delayed, not for lack of intent, but due to outdated land acquisition processes, fragmented clearances, and regulatory red tape. This isn’t just an administrative issue, it’s an economic one. Industries are not mere profit engines, they are employment creators, skill builders, infrastructure enablers, and drivers of regional upliftment. When businesses struggle with delays and unpredictability, entire ecosystems suffer: workers, vendors, logistics partners, and local communities. What holding Industries back are · Land approvals stretching for years · ""Single window"" systems that open multiple bureaucratic doors ·Disconnected policy between state and Centre. · Lack of transparency in engaging with local stakeholders. This is where law must walk with ambition. If India is serious about reaching a $5 trillion economy, about ""Make in India"" and ""Aatmanirbhar Bharat,"" then Ease of Doing Business must be law, process, and culture—not a tagline. The Way Forward: · Time-bound land and environmental approvals · Digitized single-window systems that actually work · State-Centre alignment that Speaks one language on investment, infrastructure, and incentives. · Transparent engagement with local communities-Build trust, not resistance. Share the gains of industrial growth fairly. When governance and enterprise walk together, India doesn’t just grow—it leads. Let’s not make investors wait. Let’s not let communities lose hope. Let’s make policy the backbone of progress. # FromMyDesk # EaseOfDoingBusiness # IndiaDevelopment # IndustrialGrowth # LandReform # Governance # MakeInIndia # PolicyMatters # PublicPrivatePartnership # FutureOfWork # EconomicLeadership","0","neutral","0.041","2025-07-17 06:08:06"

Eleven years ago, Garib Kalyan Yojana was launched with a bold mission — to ensure every poor family in India lives with dignity, security, and opportunity.

Digital India continues to empower every farmer, vendor, and entrepreneur with access to technology and transparency. This is not relief. This is resilience-building. This is not policy on paper. This is progress at the grassroots. As we mark 11 years of this transformative journey, we remember — Garib Kalyan Yojana is not just a scheme.

I purchased this refrigerator from Reliance Digital, Rewa, with the promise of a 10-year warranty on the compressor. Additionally, I opted for a 5-year extended warranty from Reliance Digital. Unfortunately, it's been just 1 year, and the compressor has already stopped working. I have been in contact with LG Customer Care for over a week now, only to be informed repeatedly that the spare part is not available. To make matters worse, the customer service representatives have been rude and unresponsive throughout this process. On the other hand, Reliance Digital has been of no help either—they are simply shifting responsibility to LG without providing any solution. It's incredibly frustrating to see such a lack of accountability and customer care from these brands. I trusted both LG and Reliance Digital with their claims of reliability and extended warranties, but this experience has been nothing short of a nightmare. @LG and @RelianceDigital, I urge you to step up and take responsibility for resolving this issue. Consumers deserve better service and accountability, especially when we've invested in long-term warranties. I hope this escalation brings some urgency to resolve my issue promptly.

Advani, I.K. Gujral, Manmohan Singh, and Ram Jethmalani had to abandon their homes during the 1947 partition? The answer isn’t just politics. It was Islamic radicalism that led to one of the worst genocides in history, where lakhs of Hindus and Sikhs were butchered. Has anything changed? No — it’s worse now. Today, the danger is internal — from infiltrators, radicals, and traitors living among us. A full-fledged anti-Hindu ecosystem is flourishing with: Vote-bank-driven opposition parties Left-liberal propagandists Pseudo-secular activists and NGOs Radical apologists in media and judiciary They defend terrorists, target Hindu sentiments, and push Hindu-phobia in the name of “minority rights.” Modern Jihad is Silent but Systematic Jihad today wears new masks — Love Jihad, Land Jihad, Food Jihad, Economic Jihad, Education Jihad — slowly altering India’s demography. In places like Kerala, West Bengal, Assam, and Muslim-majority districts, Hindus are being pushed out, forced to live in fear. Why Are Hindus Unsafe in a Hindu-Majority Nation? If we stay blind, our children may face what Hindus in Pakistan and Bangladesh suffer today — violence, conversion, or exile. Under Modi, India saw: Ram Mandir Article 370 abrogated CAA Surgical & air strikes Crackdown on terror & infiltration But had BJP not won in 2014 & 2019, India might already resemble Pakistan. What Must We Do Now? Support Modi govt — online, offline, and electorally Ensure BJP/NDA wins 2029 with a thumping majority Uproot all anti-Hindu political elements Unite every Hindu — beyond caste or language Become fearless Sanatani warriors Spiritual leaders, Akharas & Hindu orgs must now act TOGETHER Do We Want Another 1947? If we stay distracted by comfort and entertainment, history will repeat itself. Will we betray the sacrifice of Shivaji, Pratap, Lakshmibai? Will we let Bharat’s identity be erased? The time to rise is NOW. Protect Sanatana Dharma. Defend Bharat.

A Wake-Up Call from a Chinese Analyst Despite our potential, India still struggles with deep-rooted structural issues. One key reason? We’ve neglected rural development. If we can build highways and smart cities, why not factories in villages? Why force migration when we can create jobs where people live? Walk into any rural shop — you’ll find cold drinks, cakes, and imported snacks. But where are our traditional Indian foods, rich in nutrition and heritage? It’s not just about infrastructure or food. It’s about mindset.

Be aware of the situation and make decisions accordingly. Commitment: Players exhibit commitment to their team, their roles, and the game. It’s essential to stay dedicated. Hope: Never give up. Even when the odds seem against you, hope can turn the game around. 2. Football : Seizing Opportunities: Success often hinges on seizing fleeting chances. Like winning a silver medal, sometimes it’s about that split-second decision. 3.Golf : Defying Odds: Golfers can overcome opponents who appear unbeatable. Persistence, skill, and mental strength matter. 4.Table Tennis : Aggression vs. Coolness: Balancing aggression with composure is key. Wait for the right moment to strike. 5.Badminton : Team Play: When your partner faces adversity, step up. Give them time to recover, and together, you can secure victory. Life lessons:Never give up. Even when the odds seem against you, hope can turn the game around. # FieldServiceEast # timemanagement # mentalhealth # mentalhealthawareness # servicemanagement # fieldservicemanagement # lgelectronics # fieldserviceasia # whirlpool # CustomerService # customerexperience # customercare # operationsmanagement # customersupport # customercommunication #nps# # cxstrategy # symphony # operationalexcellence # mygovindia # mygov # namo # excellentcommunication # leadership # team # fieldproxy # fieldserviceasia # fieldsalesjobs # inventicon # Job # Openings # Leads , # Job # Connections # LGindia # Samasungindia # Linked # HR # Social # Media # Marketing # eMarketing # Association # Network # TheRecruiterNetwork # Harvard # Business # Review # TheProjectManager # Telecom # Professionals : # LTE , # M2M , # OTT , # Cloud # Computing , # Mobile # VAS , # Apps & # Telecom # UNICORN # Startups # Entrepreneurs # Digital # Marketing","35","neutral","0.05","2025-07-17 06:09:26"

Yesterday, my heart simply sank. My son called to say, “Hey Mom, I need to fly to Kolkata for a trial.” I found myself whispering the Hanuman Chalisa while booking his flight, dropping him to the airport, and then tracking every second of his journey—two hours of helpless breath-holding. I’m not a passive thinker. I’m a mother who packed her son off to Spain in the middle of COVID because he had a dream. And now here I am, behaving exactly like my own worried mother—whom I used to laugh at. But this isn’t fear. It’s a conscious reaction to the recent Air India flight crash. That crash took 241 passengers, and heartbreakingly, also claimed the lives of medical college students who were simply eating lunch in their hostel cafeteria when the plane fell from the sky. We regulate banks heavily—because they hold our money. But what about the industries that hold our lives? Aviation, transportation, and infrastructure must be regulated with even greater intensity. When companies prioritize cost-cutting over human lives, and regulators don’t keep pace with oversight, we’re not just risking passengers—we’re risking people on the ground, in classrooms, in homes. It’s time to ask: Are our regulators empowered enough to challenge global giants and enforce safety? Do we have real-time transparency in maintenance, training, and operational audits? Who holds accountability when public trust is betrayed? This is not just about grief. This is about responsibility. About ensuring that no mother ever has to hold her breath over something that should be routine. About ensuring that cost-cutting never costs lives. We owe this to every life lost. We owe this to every life flying today. Safety is not optional. Regulation is not red tape. It is protection. # AviationSafety # ConsciousLeadership # PublicSafetyFirst # RegulateResponsibly # AirIndiaCrash # Leadership # Motherhood # HanumanChalisa # India","103","neutral","0.097","2025-07-17 06:09:26"

Everything was normal. With excitement and love, I was heading to Lucknow for a YouTube Event.. 1:20 PM – I had pizza and a soft drink at the airport. 1:37 PM – I uploaded an Instagram story. Everything was still calm… until I got an email: “Your flight is delayed” – IndiGo (InterGlobe Aviation Ltd) Confused, I rushed to an air hostess to ask why. She broke into tears and with trembling eyes, she said: “Sir… please check the news.” And what I saw next left me shaken. The flight I had just seen take off… had crashed. The entire airport was gripped with fear. People were calling their loved ones, trying to feel alive in the presence of death. My phone was flooded with calls: “Are you okay?” But all I could think of were those souls who weren’t as lucky. So many lives lost in a moment. Just like that — from passengers to headlines. That moment changed me. We chase careers, goals, fame, money… but nothing is guaranteed. It could have been me on that flight. From today, I’ve decided — I’ll live openly, even if life only gives me 4 more days. Because life is not promised. And to the airlines — Please, stop hiring only on appearance. Start hiring the best engineers and safety professionals. A beautiful face doesn’t make a flight safe — maintenance and skill do. Sometimes, life is more important than profit. Om Shanti to every soul lost today.

But beyond the win, it was the leadership moments that truly inspired me. Virat Kohli didn’t just hold the trophy. He held space for those who shaped RCB’s journey: He called Chris Gayle onto the stage — honouring past firepower. He embraced AB de Villiers and Ravi Shastri — silent pillars of RCB’s evolution.

Great leaders never forget who stood beside them before the world celebrated them. As a project leader, I see this every day. Projects don’t succeed because of one person. They succeed when teams stay loyal, grounded, and united — even when no one’s watching. So here’s what I take away: Celebrate with humility Honour the journey Lift others, even when you’re the one being lifted Leadership isn’t just about delivering results — it’s about building stories people want to remember.

From May 5 to July 4, I interned as a Marketing Operations Intern at LG Electronics India (Bhubaneswar). And honestly? It was a wild, insightful, laughter-packed ride. What I Did (and Didn't Expect): Excel Mastery From decoding KPIs to cleaning chaotic sell-out data, I became the unofficial ‘Excel Guy’ of the office. Who knew pivot tables would feel like mini victories? Tried My Hands at ERP Systems Used APMS & RMP to track how promotional money moves and how pop materials travel. Retail Store Tours Walked into more outlets than food joints. Observed brand hygiene (display, store, promoter), clicked photos and interacted with promoters (some real talkers out there). Made Presentations Created decks on LG visibility, outlet performance and modern trade. Slides filled with store photos, not stock images! People Who Made It Unforgettable: Bikash Chandra Dubey Sir – the motivator I didn’t know I needed. sandeep kumar Das Sir – tough love specialist. Sovan Sir – introduced me to ERP like a magician unveiling secrets. Kailash Sir & Sumitra Ma'am – Excel & good vibes duo. Ranadeep, Neerav, Pandey Sir – shared knowledge, motivation and calm in chaos. The Marketing Team – equal parts fun and fantastic. We discussed more about food than forecasts. Moments I Won’t Forget: - Watching sales managers roast sales promoters like it’s a stand-up act. - Confusing store sales staff for brand employees (and then realizing the hierarchy is a maze). What I Learnt: - Communication beats theory. - Observation > assumption. - You don’t need to know everything—you just need to start, listen, adapt and stay consistent. Grateful To: - I Business Institute for giving me the stage - Vijay Ranjan Singh sir, Siddhant Rana sir and Rohit Joshi sir for giving me a chance - Vaishali Verma Ma’am for guiding me - Last but not least LG Bhubaneswar Marketing Team for treating me like one of your own And every person who helped me realize that “intern” is not a tag, it’s a mindset. P.S. Yes, I submitted a SIP report too... because, well... marks matter But that also did with equal hardwork. # InternshipJourney # LGIndia # MarketingIntern # RetailStories # Operations # FieldWork # CorporateLife # BhubaneswarDiaries # FunAtWork # Gratitude # Internship # work","54","positive","0.271","2025-07-17 06:09:54"

Gone in seconds. Pratik Joshi had spent the last six years in London — a software professional working toward one goal: building a better life for his wife and three young children, who remained in India. After years of waiting on clearances and paperwork, the dream was finally coming true. Just two days ago, his wife, Dr. Komi Vyas, a respected doctor in Udaipur, resigned from her job. The bags were packed. The goodbyes were said. A new chapter awaited. This morning, the family of five boarded Air India Flight 171 to London, their hearts filled with hope. They clicked a selfie. They shared it with loved ones. It was meant to be the start of their new life. But they never made it. The flight crashed. No one survived. A lifetime of dreams — gone in moments. A brutal reminder: life is fragile, unpredictable, and often unfair. Everything we build. Everything we hope for. Everything we love. It all hangs by a thread. So while you can — Live. Love. Forgive. Celebrate.

I joined LG Electronics as a Marketing Intern, ready to dive deep into: Market research Consumer insights Brand strategy And I did exactly that. But life had a surprise in store for me. ‍ From Spreadsheets to Sales Floor For a few days, I found myself far from dashboards and pitch decks… On the retail floor. In the middle of a live sales activation. Face to face with a real customer. And then it happened: I sold my first-ever OLED TV worth ₹2 Lakhs. No mock drills. No roleplays. Just pure belief. And a real conversation with someone making a real decision. That moment rewired how I think about marketing: Marketing creates curiosity. Sales earns trust. Knowing the product isn’t enough — believing in it is the game-changer. The most powerful insight? Seeing a person nod, smile, and say: “I’ll take it.” That day, I didn’t just “assist a sale.” I drove revenue for the company. I felt the heartbeat of the brand through the eyes of the customer. Now when I think “target audience” — I see real people. And when I work on strategy — I imagine the floor conversations that follow. Grateful to LG India and the amazing team for trusting me to wear multiple hats — and for giving me a front-row seat to how marketing and sales truly go hand-in-hand. Special thanks to Anirban Basu Sir , DR. RIK PAUL Sir, Dr. Ritu Chhikara ma'am whose teaching in Marketing and Sales & Distribution truly came alive during this experience.

Last week, I had the opportunity to accompany my manager ma'am on a market visit to the upcountry region — a journey that reshaped my perspective on visibility, brand ownership, and frontline execution. Here’s what I learned beyond the metrics: Visibility is not a checkbox — it’s a strategy. We assessed every branding spot: Is it still relevant? Is it actually seen? Is it creating recall or just filling space? This led to crucial decisions on whether to retain, replace, or redesign existing assets. Location is everything. We identified new high-impact branding points — not just based on footfall, but behavioral flow — understanding how people move, pause, and perceive. Listening to trade partners is non-negotiable. We sat down with channel partners to understand: What’s moving, what’s not What competitors are offering Where they feel supported — and where they need more help in marketing, branding, or advertising Frontline matters more than we think. We attended a promoter training session, observed knowledge gaps, and understood the importance of consistent brand messaging at the final touchpoint — the shop floor. Competition never sleeps. From subtle wall placements to in-store tactics, competitors are agile and aggressive. Being No. 1 is great — but retaining leadership means spotting threats early and acting faster. Key Takeaway? Upcountry markets are not secondary. They’re the foundation of volume, trust, and long-term market share. They may not trend on social media — but they define reality in sales. I’m grateful to the LG India team and Shiksha Rawat ma'am for giving me a front-row seat to real brand-building. Because real marketing doesn’t happen in meetings — it happens in markets.

This isn’t sudden. This is three consecutive years of decline. 𝟐𝟎𝟐𝟎: 𝟗𝟔𝟒 → 𝟐𝟎𝟐𝟏: 𝟗𝟎𝟖 → 𝟐𝟎𝟐𝟐: 𝟖𝟗𝟏 The data, released by the Office of the Registrar General of India, comes from the 𝐂𝐢𝐯𝐢𝐥 𝐑𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐒𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦 (𝐂𝐑𝐒) and covers 254.4 lakh births and 86.5 lakh deaths registered in India in 2022. CRS records real-time, localised data of every birth, death, and stillbirth to track demographic shifts, policy outcomes, and gender trends. What does the latest CRS data reveal? 1⃣ Only 𝟒𝟕.𝟔% of registered births nationally were girls, reflecting a continuing gender imbalance. 2⃣ 𝐌𝐚𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐬𝐡𝐭𝐫𝐚 (𝟗𝟎𝟔), 𝐓𝐞𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐚𝐧𝐚 (𝟗𝟎𝟕) 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐆𝐮𝐣𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐭 (𝟗𝟎𝟖), states with high female literacy and development indices, reported troubling numbers. 3⃣ In contrast, 𝐍𝐚𝐠𝐚𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐝 (𝟏,𝟎𝟔𝟖), 𝐀𝐫𝐮𝐧𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐥 𝐏𝐫𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐬𝐡 (𝟏,𝟎𝟑𝟔) 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐊𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐥𝐚 (𝟗𝟕𝟏) reported significantly higher SRB, reflecting gender-balanced social norms. 4⃣ Birth registrations rose from 2.42 crore (2021) to 2.54 crore (2022). Registered deaths dropped from 1.02 crore to 86.5 lakh in the same period. 5⃣ 56.5% of births and 40.5% of deaths were registered in urban areas, indicating stronger registration systems in cities. What is the broader governance meaning of this? Sex ratio at birth is the earliest indicator of gender bias, often shaped by deep-rooted son preference, sex-selective practices, and systemic neglect. Thus, a declining SRB reflects not just private choices, but a failure of the state to ensure legal, medical, and social safeguards for the girl child. 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐁𝐨𝐭𝐭𝐨𝐦 𝐋𝐢𝐧𝐞? SRB isn’t just a statistic. It’s a story of missing girls — and a reminder that gender-just governance begins at birth.

It’s where power meets purpose. Where policies are born, and history is written every single day.

They were doctors, students, and professionals. People who had plans for tomorrow. People who never got to send that one last message. That one moment changed everything. And it could have been any of us. We think we have time. To fix that broken friendship. To say ""I love you."" To chase what we’ve been putting off. But sometimes, life doesn’t give us a warning. So today, don’t scroll past this without asking yourself: Have you told the people you love… that you love them? Have you picked up the phone, just to say “I’m thinking of you”? Are you holding on to something that’s not worth the weight? If you're still waiting to: → Express what’s in your heart → Say “I’m sorry” or “I forgive you” → Take a break because you're burnt out → Make that long-delayed visit → Start the project that’s personal, not just professional Please… Don't wait for the perfect moment. This is the perfect moment — because it exists. And you're in it. We don't control how long we have. But we do control how present we are with the people and purpose that matter. So love louder. Forgive faster. Speak honestly. Take that leap — not because it's easy, but because it's meaningful. What’s one thing you’ve been holding back that you will do today? Comment below.

Newsletter for Curated Global","I GO! | Edition 16: A Passage to India This week: Delhi. Lucknow. Chennai. Bangalore. (In 6 days!) “It never bored them to hear words, words; they breathed them with the cool night air.” — E.M. Forster Lately, I’ve been writing a lot about liminality-those dreamy, in-between spaces that invite calm introspection. India is not that kind of place. India demands full attention and presence. Surrender. This week, I crossed four cities in six days—with Saint-Gobain exploring how we can help make the world a better home (stay tuned!) But this was less a “trip” and more a passage in—not to—India. In Delhi, the air hums with heat and human energy - 30 million lives unfolding at once. In Lucknow, we stopped just long enough to marvel at the Bara Imambara, late afternoon sunlight dancing on centuries of symmetry. In Chennai, a brushstroke of the South, and in Bangalore, India's garden city, a glimpse of India’s next chapter - buzzing, modern, purposeful. Yes, it was a whirlwind. But what a ride. India is not a destination, it’s a stream of consciousness. A swirl of temples, rickshaws, honks, fragrant food, surprising turns, radiant smiles. Where beauty and deprivation coexist. Where innovation is thriving. Where paradox is the norm. Where spirituality and ancient history ooze out of every street. As Osho said: “India is not just geography or history. It is something more: a metaphor, poetry, something invisible but very tangible. It is vibrating with certain energy fields which no other country can claim.” From the West, it looks chaotic. But step in closer-and it works. Shockingly well. Flights on time. Meetings on point. Professionals prepared and engaged. A nation going about the quiet business of becoming Asia’s next superpower. “India? It’s like 10 countries rammed into one,” someone in Lucknow told me. Exactly. With 1.4+ billion people, nearly 15% of global GDP growth forecast in 2025, and a cultural depth few nations can match, India is not just rising-it is redefining scale. Not through perfection, but through movement. Resilience. Will. To cross it, even briefly, is not just a journey. It’s a passage into a different way of being. You don’t leave with conclusions. You leave with sensations. The feeling of being deeply alive. Until next time....

Just another morning. Another journey. Another flight. But on June 12, 2025, Air India Flight AI171 headed from Ahmedabad to London never made it past the sky. Within moments of takeoff, it crashed into the canteen of a local medical college hostel, leaving behind 241 lives lost on board, and claiming many more on the ground, students, workers, and innocent families. This wasn’t just an aviation tragedy. It was a rupture in hundreds of timelines. A morning that split life into before and after. The story caught national attention. But beyond the headlines, something deeper lingered: We move fast meetings, meals, messages expecting tomorrow will show up like clockwork. But the truth? Even the most ‘normal’ day can turn into a final chapter. Some people never got the chance to say goodbye. Others returned to a home that no longer felt full. Some lost every picture they hadn’t yet taken. This incident doesn’t just ask us to mourn it asks us to pause. What would you do differently if you remembered today isn’t guaranteed? Who would you call, forgive, listen to, or simply hug tighter? Are we truly living or just moving? We can’t predict the future. But we can change how we show up in the present. With more softness. With slower steps. With deeper gratitude for what’s still here. To those who lost someone that day no words are enough. But we carry their memory by choosing to live more fully, more consciously. May their stories echo in our choices.

A day that will now be remembered as Black Day — not just for Gujarat, but for every heart that now carries an unexpected goodbye. We often take life for granted, don’t we? We laugh with someone, end a call with a cheerful “Take care”, and move on with our day. Never once thinking — what if that was the last time? You board a flight — chasing dreams, going home to loved ones, starting a new chapter. And someone, somewhere, is waiting to welcome you. But sometimes, that welcome never comes. This tragedy reminds us of something we often forget in our busy lives: > There is no “baadme kar lenge.” Only now. Tell people how much they mean to you — now. Hug them tightly — now. Start working towards your dreams — now. Don’t wait for the right time. Because the truth is, we don’t really know how much time we have. Let’s stop postponing moments. Let’s stop assuming we’ll always get another chance. Let’s start living with a little more love, a little more purpose — today. --- Some goodbyes are so sudden, they don’t even let us say goodbye.

Today: A heartbreaking helicopter crash near Kedarnath — 7 precious lives, including a 23-month-old baby, gone forever. & every time we ask why, we get the same cold reply: “Investigation still in progress.” But how long will we keep waiting for answers that never come? Why does this keep happening? Where are we going wrong? is this truly “fate”? is it systemic failure wearing the mask of inevitability? It’s time we asked some hard, uncomfortable questions like all time we ask. Where are the statutory authorities when lives depend on them? Are safety checks just paperwork rituals with no real enforcement? ‍ What are our babus & officials truly being held accountable for? Are our politicians only interested in ribbon-cuttings, flyovers & photo-ops, while ignoring public safety & lives? Every incident screams of: Outdated protocols Ignored red flags Poor preparedness Reaction instead of prevention We don’t need sympathy posts. We don’t want another condolence tweet. We need accountability. We demand preventive action before the next breaking news. Let this be a call, not just for justice, but for transformation. For every lost life. For every shattered family. For every Indian who still believes we can do better. India deserves better. Let’s not just mourn. Let’s speak. Let’s question.

JANUARY Train panic in Jalgaon - 13 dead, fleeing a fire that didn’t exist. Stampede at Kumbh - 30 crushed under faith. No crowd control. No lessons learned. FEBRUARY Uttarakhand avalanche - 8 buried alive. Where were the alerts? Delhi railway footbridge collapse - 18 gone. The bridge was already flagged. No one cared. APRIL Deesa factory explosion - 21 incinerated. Expired licenses. Illegal storage. Still operating. Why? MAY Mass shooting in Kashmir - 24 murdered at a tourist spot. No CCTV. No trail. No names. Floods across South India - cities underwater. Warnings too late or never sent. JUNE Air India Flight AI‑171 crash - 241 dead. Hit a medical hostel. ONE survivor. Ship explosion off Kerala - crew vanished. Fire “under investigation.” Do you get it now? These aren’t incidents. They’re executions. And someone, somewhere, is benefitting from our blind spots. Who? Who profits when chaos spreads and accountability disappears? Who grows stronger while India mourns? We are not watching tragedies unfold.

I’ve never met Shah Rukh Khan in real life. The closest I came was back in 2022, at an event in Delhi organized by LG India to launch their new OLED TV lineup. I was part of the Home Entertainment team (TVs) at the time, working as an Associate Marketing Manager, so I had the chance to attend. Now, I’m not a hardcore SRK fan. But like every full-blooded Bollywood-loving Indian, I was thrilled at the idea of seeing him in person—and maybe even getting a photo clicked. But tough luck—only two folks from Amazon got to go on stage and meet him. I wasn’t one of them. Still, I was just a few feet away, watching him up close. And what I saw made a lasting impression. First, he unveiled LG’s new line of TVs. And believe me—he knew the product inside out. Not just reading off a script, but actually explaining features, answering questions from the audience, and engaging with the product like a seasoned Product Manager. I was blown away. Then came the partner felicitation ceremony. Around 50 partners were called up—one or two people each—to receive awards from SRK. That meant dozens of handshakes, photos, and moments. And here’s what stood out: he didn’t just go through the motions. He asked each person who they were, spoke with them, smiled, handed out the awards. When an elderly gentleman struggled to walk up the steps, SRK got off the stage, helped him up personally, and continued doing that for anyone who needed it. He did this relentlessly until the very last award was handed out. And that’s when I truly understood why he’s so loved. You hear stories about SRK’s work ethic and humility—but when you see it, it hits different. As a manager, as a leader—that day reminded me that no matter how big you are, being humble and reachable is everything. Still hoping I get to meet the great man someday—and share this story with him. Big thanks to LG India for that unforgettable evening. P.S. The photo I’m sharing is from the internet. I had clicked tons of photos that day but deleted them all eventually—because I didn’t get one with SRK. # Leadership # Humility # ShahRukhKhan # MarketingLife # LessonsInLeadership # Gratitude # LGIndia # BehindTheScenes # CareerReflections","44","positive","0.18","2025-07-17 06:18:37"

In our daily lives, we often hesitate — caught in the loop of ""what ifs"", waiting for the perfect time, deferring joy, postponing dreams. We hold back from decisions out of fear — fear of failure, judgment, or uncertainty.

We don’t control outcomes. We don’t control tomorrow. But we do control the actions we take today. So take that step. Say what you’ve been meaning to. Start what you’ve been delaying.

CSR Spend: ₹15,524 Cr Unspent CSR Funds: ₹1,475 Cr – highest in 5 years Why can't we direct even a portion of this toward building India's Recommerce Infrastructure? E-waste collection Refurbishment & reuse skill-building Reverse logistics frameworks Consumer awareness campaigns Urban mining of unused electronics We’re not just talking environmental need—this is a massive socio-economic opportunity.

Here’s a quick glance at what we’ve been witnessing recently Recent Disturbing Incidents That Flooded Our Screens: 1. Ahmedabad Plane Crash – A tragic accident that once again raised questions about air safety and crisis preparedness. 2. Meghalaya’s Raja Raghuvanshi Case – A complex legal and emotional storm, stirring debates on morality, law, and influence. 3. Rajkot Game Zone Fire – 27 lives, many of them children, lost in a blaze at a gaming arcade. A chilling reminder of poor safety protocols and administrative failure. 4. Manipur Unrest & Internet Shutdowns – Ethnic violence, communal clashes, and prolonged silence from those in power. Social media tried to be the voice—but algorithms buried it under gossip. 5. Suicides of Students & Professionals – Every week, we read about a young life lost—due to academic pressure, unemployment, or toxic work culture. 6. Rising Cases of Medical Negligence – Viral videos show patients being denied oxygen, surgeries delayed, ambulances unavailable. Trust in healthcare shaken. How This Impacts Us (Even If We Don’t Notice): Cognitive Overload: The brain isn’t built to process so much grief, so often. Emotional Burnout: We either feel angry all the time or completely numb. Empathy Erosion: Constant exposure dulls our compassion—we scroll past suffering. Fear of Missing Out on Pain (FOMOP): Yes, even trauma becomes trendable. Mental Health Crisis: Anxiety, insomnia, and helplessness are now common. So What Can We Do? A Digital Survival Kit for the Empathic Mind: Filter Wisely – Mute noise. Follow credible, constructive voices. Reflect Before You Share – Is it real? Is it respectful? Is it helpful? Take Digital Detoxes – Being offline is also a form of activism. Prioritize Solution-Centric Content – Share petitions, helplines, verified data. Talk About It IRL – Conversations offline create more clarity than comments online. Be Human – Behind every viral news is a family shattered. Let’s not forget the human cost. Final Thought: In this age of scrolling sadness and viral violence, we must ask: Are we consuming news, or is it consuming us? Are we spreading awareness, or just amplifying anxiety? We owe it to ourselves—and to each other—to be conscious, calm, and critically curious citizens of the internet. # DigitalConsciousness # SocialMediaEthics # AhmedabadCrash # RajaRaghuvanshi # RajkotFire # MentalHealthAwareness # ManipurUnrest # DigitalDetox # MediaLiteracy # NewsFatigue # GenZPerspective # EmpathyMatters # LinkedInVoices","10","neutral","-0.069","2025-07-17 06:19:55"

It feels like discovering a hidden level in the game of content/research/communication. During my internship, I came across this term: Vox Populi , literally meaning ""voice of the people"", and realized how powerful these quick, raw, on-the-spot opinions can be. I thought I was just watching fun clips on TV or social media… turns out, it’s a legit interviewing technique used across journalism, marketing, research, and more! The other types of Interviews you should know about: 1. Vox Pop (Voice of the People) Short, spontaneous interviews done in public to capture quick opinions on trending or general topics. 2. Structured Interview Pre-planned questions asked in a fixed order, often used in research and HR for consistency. 3. Unstructured Interview Conversational and open-ended; allows the interviewee to guide the flow, great for qualitative insights. 4. Semi-Structured Interview Mix of prepared and spontaneous questions, gives structure while allowing flexibility. 5. In-Depth Interview (IDI) Detailed, one-on-one conversation focused on understanding personal experiences, motivations, or behaviors. 6. Focus Group Interview Group discussion led by a moderator to explore attitudes, beliefs, and opinions around a topic. 7. Phone/Remote Interview Conducted over phone or video call, common in recruitment and academic research. 8. Panel Interview One interviewee answers questions from a group of interviewers, often used in hiring and academic settings. 9. Behavioral Interview Focuses on past behavior to predict future performance, commonly used in job interviews. 10. Stress Interview Designed to test how someone reacts under pressure, less common but still used in high-stakes roles. My takeaway from the first week of my internship is that even the simplest interactions, like a 10-second chat on the street! can turn into powerful storytelling tools when done right. # InternInsights # LearningInAction # VoxPop # InterviewSkills # FromDeskToDetail # Career # InternChronicles # LGIndia # Internship # LG","52","positive","0.106","2025-07-17 06:21:22"

Dreams unfinished. Conversations left incomplete. --- As I read through the heartbreaking headlines and survivor stories, something inside me cracked. Not out of fear. But from a deep, soul-stirring realization: > We are not promised the next hour—let alone tomorrow. --- A Missed Flight Became a Life Saved. One missed that flight due to a delayed cab. Another changed plans at the last moment. And just like that… they were spared. Is it luck? Coincidence? Divine will? Call it what you want—but moments like these force us to surrender to the reality that there’s something greater at play. --- It Made Me Reflect: How many things do I take for granted daily? How often do I delay saying “I love you,” “I’m sorry,” or “thank you”? Why do I worry about things I can’t control, instead of appreciating what I already have? Realized that This tragedy isn’t just a headline. It’s a wake-up call. Be humble—we control less than we think. Be grateful—you’re still here, breathing, reading this. Be present—life isn’t about someday. It’s happening now. Trust a higher power—even when it doesn’t make sense. --- To the 241 Souls We Lost: You will not be forgotten.

The government’s commitment to enhancing air connectivity, promoting regional airports, and fostering private sector participation has been instrumental. Private Players: Tata Group and IndiGo Airlines are key players driving expansion. Tata Group’s partnership with Singapore Airlines led to the birth of Vistara, a full-service carrier.

Every technicial offers to check if the gas level is okay, even if cooling is happening. 7.The affluent , gullible customer is so heavily sold on preventive maintenance that he agrees to every suggestion to nip the problem in the bud. 8.While every technician is not dishonest , you cant identify the honest one. 9. He will find a way to tell you that you are headed for a problem and that the company's rate is Rs 2800/- plus GST , he can do it for Rs 2500/- net without bill . We will fall for the without bill option. Even if it is with bill , the warranty is 3 months . It should be 12 months. 10.All companies have left open a loose end to ensure that the technicians are available in season and are allowed to create this # hiddencharge . 11.Without the earnings from this # gas filling activity , AC's technicians would not be available at all. 12. Consider the economics of earnings from 1 full gas cylinder that they carry ( the figures may be exxagerated - primarily to make the point . Data has been taken from technicians / internet) # Cylinder cost : Below Rs 3000. Top Up cost per AC/- Rs 2200-Rs 2500 per AC- no bill. Rs 2800 + GST with bill 1 Cylinder can be used to top up at least 10 AC's So on personal basis his revenue from gas filling is minimum Rs 22000 and profit is Rs 19000 per day . A/c technicians earn upto Rs 8 lakhs in 7 months . Many go back to their villages for 4 to 5 months ! 13. I have come to the conclusion that problems of repeted gas filling are directly correlated with annual AC servicing. Typically the gas issues emerge 6 months after # UrbanCompany visits or within 3 months of any technician. 14. The cadre of AC technicians have an unwritten code which is well understood and accepted and by law of averages - everyone gains through the ""gas"" code 15. We are in # noida 1 of our # AC 's is not easily accessible - and has not had a gas leak problem AC's which are accessible to technicians have annual gas filling needs. When we were in # delhi or # Lucknow , we never had to fill gas in any AC , split or window ever . You will not see a lot of AC repair guys in housing colonies and Government flats , but you will see enough guys in condos. ......page 2","23","positive","0.171","2025-07-17 06:22:58"

And today, with a heart full of nervous excitement, I’m sharing something I’ve been dreaming of for a while. I've always felt this strange, persistent voice inside me... Asking: Why aren’t we talking about the things that matter? The real stuff. The world. The pain. The potential. The power we hold. So today, I’m starting. Not waiting for a bigger stage. Not waiting to be “qualified enough.” Just... beginning.Drumroll Youth for Global Issues is live. It’s a digital movement. A podcast. A platform. A space where young people (like you and me) talk about things we often scroll past — inequality, climate, conflict, identity, education, mental health, and everything in between. And I’m also launching a community project in my colony in Delhi, called The Deaf Call Community, where we’ll organize real, small events to bring people together. Because sometimes, even in a loud world, no one’s listening. And it’s time we change that. Why am I doing this? Because I’m tired of the silence. Because more youth need to speak, lead, create, and care. Because I want to build something real before I graduate. Because I’ve felt powerless — and I don’t want to feel that anymore. And most of all, because I believe that change doesn’t have to start big. It just has to start. With a poster. A podcast. A conversation in the park. So if you’re reading this, Maybe this is your sign to join in. Let’s have conversations that matter. Let’s create joy, justice, and change — one small moment at a time. The movement begins now.

I called it a marketing bootcamp, life school, and story archive — all rolled into 10 weeks. From sweating it out in upcountry markets to pitching in brand meetings... From observing silent sellouts to scripting a culture film... I didn’t just work at LG Electronics India — I grew. I unlearned. And I understood something no textbook ever taught: Marketing isn’t about making noise. It’s about making meaning — at the right time, in the right place, for the right person. Whether it was: A promoter waiting for updated POP A faded wall painting still driving ₹1.5 Cr in revenue Or a customer smiling because we solved their problem I saw marketing in its rawest, realest form — as empathy delivered at scale. Grateful for the people who made this internship truly extraordinary: ‍ Shiksha Rawat Ma’am – My manager, mentor, and sounding board. Your trust built my confidence more than any metric ever could. Thank you for making me feel like I belonged, from Day 1. Ankit Kaul Sir – For showing me how strategy and leadership intersect on the ground. Rupesh Kumar Sir – For trusting me with brand-impacting opportunities. Rahul Sir, Arjun Sir, Sintu Sir, Sanjeev Sir – For offering real frontline insights where marketing truly lives. Vijay Ranjan Singh Sir & Siddhant Rana Sir – For building a culture where interns are contributors, not just observers. To my professors: DR. RIK PAUL sir, Dr. Jaya Ahuja Raina ma'am, Soumyadeep Kundu, Ph.D ., Anirban Basu , Dr. Ritu Chhikara ma'am – thank you for preparing me to walk in ready to listen, absorb, and contribute with confidence. To my seniors Smarak Routray and Piyush Tiwari — thank you for being the silent forces in the background. Your calm encouragement meant more than you know. Grateful to be part of an ecosystem like LG India and LG Electronics — where learning isn’t just encouraged, it’s embedded into every experience. Key Takeaway: Don’t treat your internship like a checklist. Treat it like a mirror. See what it reflects back to you — about the work, the brand, and most importantly, about yourself. Here's to 10 weeks of: Campaigns. KPIs. Chaos. Clarity. Character.

As incomes rise and urbanization continues in India, the adoption of air conditioning is expected to increase significantly in the coming decades. # NeverBefore Symphony Limited. # olympic # paris # paris2024 # FieldServiceEast # timemanagement # mentalhealth # mentalhealthawareness # servicemanagement # fieldservicemanagement # lgelectronics # fieldserviceasia # whirlpool # CustomerService # customerexperience # customercare # operationsmanagement # customersupport # customercommunication #nps# # cxstrategy # symphony # operationalexcellence # mygovindia # mygov # namo # excellentcommunication # leadership # team # fieldproxy # fieldserviceasia # fieldsalesjobs # inventicon # Job # Openings # Leads , # Job # Connections # LGindia # Samasungindia # Linked # HR # Social # Media # Marketing # eMarketing # Association # Network # TheRecruiterNetwork","32","positive","0.172","2025-07-17 06:26:59"

My 2.5-month journey with LG Electronics – Indore Region proved exactly that. This internship wasn’t about observation — it was about execution. Ownership. Learning by doing. Under the mentorship of: Mr. Ajit Kumar Singh (Marketing Manager) – I worked on POP/POSM audits, tracked brand visibility across outlets, supported vendor coordination, and understood how execution timing and material quality shape the final impact at the store. Mr. Ankush Mathur (Modern Trade Manager) – I got hands-on with Modern Trade audits across Croma and Reliance Digital stores in Indore, Dewas, and Ratlam. I created a structured MT branding tracker, noted competitor placements, and learned how product visibility directly affects consumer decisions. Mr. Shuvojit Dev (Regional Sales Trainer) – With his guidance, I gained deep product understanding across LG’s portfolio — OLEDs, QNEDs, ACs, Refrigerators, Washing Machines — and learned how to translate features into stories that drive real conversions on the shop floor. Grateful to all three mentors — Mr. Ajit Kumar Singh , Mr. Ankush Mathur , and Mr. Shuvojit Dev — for their time, trust, and belief in learning by doing. Key Highlights: Built store-wise MT audit and competitor branding report Gained real selling experience at Mehta LG Brand Shoppe Audited bundling effectiveness & POP visibility in upcountry markets Understood how LG’s backend tech and ERP tools drive retail action What’s Next? We’ve started working on a storytelling series capturing these on-ground insights — because retail marketing has stories that deserve more than just numbers.

Attending and watching the Olympic Games is an incredible experience. I had the chance to witness the Paris 2024 Olympics, and it was truly awesome! The atmosphere, the competition, and the unity among nations were unforgettable. However, my experience also highlighted some thought-provoking aspects about the representation at the Olympics. Dominance of Developed Countries The medal tally at the Olympics is often dominated by developed countries, primarily from Europe and North America. For instance, the United States, Russia, and Germany have historically been top performers. Exceptions like Australia and Japan also shine from the Pacific and Asia ⏭However, notable contributions from Africa, South America, and many parts of Asia are relatively rare and Limited Representation This raises an important question: Do the Olympic Games truly represent the world? Many sports featured in the Olympics are not widely known or played in Africa, Asia, and South America. This lack of familiarity and infrastructure can limit the chances of athletes from these regions to compete and excel ▶Fair Play or Global Event? Is it fair to call the Olympics a global event when many countries do not have a fair chance to compete? The disparity in resources, training facilities, and exposure to various sports creates an uneven playing field. While the Olympics aim to bring the world together, the reality is that the representation is skewed towards a few powerful nations A Question of Thought The Olympics are a magnificent celebration of human potential and international unity. However, for them to truly represent the world, there needs to be a more inclusive approach that gives all countries a fair chance to participate and succeed. This could involve investing in sports infrastructure in underrepresented regions and promoting a wider variety of sports globally. What are your thoughts on this? Do you think the Olympics can evolve to become more inclusive? # NeverBefore # Symphony Limited. # olympic # paris # paris2024 # FieldServiceEast # timemanagement # mentalhealth # mentalhealthawareness # servicemanagement # fieldservicemanagement # lgelectronics # fieldserviceasia # whirlpool # CustomerService # customerexperience # customercare # operationsmanagement # customersupport # customercommunication #nps# # cxstrategy # symphony # operationalexcellence # mygovindia # mygov # namo # excellentcommunication # leadership # team # fieldproxy # fieldserviceasia # fieldsalesjobs # inventicon # Job # Openings # Leads , # Job # Connections # LGindia # Samasungindia # Linked # HR # Social # Media # Marketing # eMarketing # Association # Network # TheRecruiterNetwork","11","positive","0.291","2025-07-17 06:27:37"
